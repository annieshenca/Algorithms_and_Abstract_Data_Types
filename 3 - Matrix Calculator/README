Description:
-Sparse.java: Main program. Takes in two arguments(input file and output file), and use Matrix.java
                to manage the input matrices, then out print to output file.

-Matrix.java: Creates n x n matrices as array of lists, with functions that calculates matrix add,
                subtract, and multiplication manipulations.

-List.java: List ADT fuctions. Functions with the ability to point and travel through the linked
                list with cursor.

-MatrixTest.java: A test file to test if the functions in Matrix.java works correctly or not.

-ListTest.java: A test file to test if the functions in List.java works correctly or not.

-Makefile: A building tool used to simplify the compiling and removing of files.

-README: Includes student information, table of content, and description of files.
